# Commerce - Project 2 

### An eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to:

- Create Listings/auctions
  - Title, Description, Image, starting and current prices and more
  - Other users can bid on the item
  - Listing can be added to a Watchlist
  - Comments are available
  - Closing an auction and the highest bid wins the item
- Categories to filter listings
  - Users can create their own if desired
- Watchlist page for a user to follow listings
- Main index page showing all *available* listings

With this project I also experimented a bit with the design for specific listings 
on the index or watchlist page, It turned out nicely. I've also incorporated features
that were out of the scope of the projects, like:

- Form validation:
  - Image file extensions
  - Image size
  - Bid price
